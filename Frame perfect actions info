UI interactions (inventory, toolbelt):
On an opened UI, arbitrary amounts of interactions per tick are possible. A UI has to be closed for a tick to be able to open a new UI (i.e. you cannot press E twice in the same frame or similar).

Selection interactions (mine, take out/put into machines):
The selection can only be moved once per tick. It is possible to do arbitrary put interactions in the same tick (for example, put 3 stacks from the toolbelt into a chest without using the UI) and it is possible to do a put action and open the UI, but not a put action and a take action.

Build:
It is only possible to build if the frame started while holding a buildable entity. But then, arbitrary amounts of entities can be built (even different ones, if they are in the toolbar).

Item manipulation:
After an entity has crafted an item, it is only possible to take it out in the frame where the item is displayed in its inventory. If in item is inserted into the player's inventory it can be used in the same frame for handcrafting.



Notes:
- arbitrary means number of clicks that factorio can process each tick. Reliably, this number seems to be around 20 but it can go up to 40.
