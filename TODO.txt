- Passive-Take produces too many warnings.
- Hide disabled category
- Two auto-take cmds that take the same item are problematic!
- Log Craft Inactivity, unoptimal movement (UI alert), dump inventory into file
- Blueprint ghosts
- Slowdown mod: position of player and selected
- UI Option: Number of commands to show.
- Typecheck for generic commands
- Redo movement logic. It's super costly at the moment.
- Replace command.finished by set_finished(command)


Low Priority:
- Passive-take should get a position param - if set, only consider that entity.
- Simple-Sequence doesnt work with build-command
- Mining burners causes errors for the auto-refuel system
- Mining and deconstructing buildings is not compatible with blueprints

Fix-Later:
- Sequence has a 1-tick delay
