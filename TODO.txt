- Set type of throw-grenade cmd.
- Blueprinting cmd should track finished commands and have a flag to end only when everything is actually built.
- Extend auto-take s.t. it can take coal if we run out?
- Redo movement logic. It's super costly at the moment.

Low Priority:
- Simple-Sequence doesnt work with build-command
- Mining burners causes errors for the auto-refuel system
- Mining and deconstructing buildings is not compatible with blueprints
